# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General

### What is AI Chat Studio?

AI Chat Studio is a modern, open-source web application that provides a unified interface to interact with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). It offers features like multi-turn conversations, offline support, export capabilities, and more.

### Is it free?

The application itself is free and open-source. However, you need to provide your own API key from AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google), and you'll be charged by them for API usage.

### How do I get started?

1. Open the application
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí API Settings
3. Enter your API key from your chosen provider
4. Select a model
5. Start chatting!

## Privacy & Security

### Is my data secure?

Yes. All your conversations and settings are stored locally in your browser using IndexedDB. Your data never leaves your device except when making API calls to your chosen AI provider.

### Do you collect my data?

No. We don't have any backend servers that collect user data. Everything runs in your browser.

### Where are my API keys stored?

API keys are encrypted and stored in your browser's local storage. They're only used to make authenticated requests to AI providers.

### Can others see my conversations?

No. Conversations are stored locally on your device only. They're not uploaded to any server.

### What happens if I clear my browser data?

All your conversations and settings will be lost. We recommend exporting your data regularly as a backup.
